Here's the detailed logical blueprint for the `removeDuplicates` function:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Removes duplicate elements from a non-strictly increasing array in-place, keeping the relative order of elements, and returns the new length of the array with unique elements.

    Algorithm: Two-pointer technique
    - Use a slow pointer to track the position of the last unique element
    - Use a fast pointer to scan through the array
    - Copy unique elements to the slow pointer position
    Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array
    Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place modification with constant extra space

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A non-strictly increasing array of integers with possible duplicates.. Constraints: Must be a non-strictly increasing array (each element is less than or equal to the next element).

    Returns:
        The number of unique elements in the modified array.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input array is not non-strictly increasing.
    """
    
    # Phase 1: Input Validation and Preprocessing
    # TODO: Check if nums is None (raise ValueError if None)
    # TODO: Handle empty array case (return 0 immediately)
    # TODO: Verify array is non-strictly increasing by checking each element <= next element
    # TODO: Raise ValueError if array violates non-strictly increasing property
    
    # Phase 2: Core Algorithm Implementation
    # TODO: Initialize slow pointer at index 1 (first element is always unique)
    # TODO: Iterate through array with fast pointer starting from index 1
    # TODO: When nums[fast] != nums[fast-1], copy to slow pointer position
    # TODO: Increment slow pointer when unique element found
    # TODO: Continue until fast pointer reaches end of array
    
    # Phase 3: Result Processing and Formatting
    # TODO: Return slow pointer value as new length of unique elements
    # TODO: Ensure nums is modified in-place up to the new length
    
    # Phase 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases
    # TODO: Handle single-element array case
    # TODO: Handle all-elements-identical case
    # TODO: Handle already-unique array case
    # TODO: Ensure no array access beyond bounds
    
    pass

# No helper functions needed for this implementation
```

**Design Justification:**
1. **Algorithm Choice**: Two-pointer technique is optimal for in-place array modification with O(n) time and O(1) space.
2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Empty array
   - Single element array
   - All elements identical
   - Already unique array
   - Large input arrays
3. **Validation**: Explicit check for non-strictly increasing property before processing.
4. **Performance**: Single pass through array ensures O(n) time complexity.
5. **Safety**: Bounds checking prevents array access errors.

The TODOs provide clear implementation steps while maintaining the contract requirements. The next phase would convert these into actual code while preserving all the specified constraints and behaviors.
