Here's the complete implementation following the logical blueprint and all specified requirements:

```python
from typing import List

def removeDuplicates(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Removes duplicate elements from a non-strictly increasing array in-place, keeping the relative order of elements, and returns the new length of the array with unique elements.

    Algorithm: Two-pointer technique
    - Use a slow pointer to track the position of the last unique element
    - Use a fast pointer to scan through the array
    - Copy unique elements to the slow pointer position
    Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array
    Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place modification with constant extra space

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A non-strictly increasing array of integers with possible duplicates.. 
        Constraints: Must be a non-strictly increasing array (each element is less than or equal to the next element).

    Returns:
        The number of unique elements in the modified array.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input array is not non-strictly increasing.

    Examples:
        >>> removeDuplicates([1,1,2])
        2
        >>> removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4])
        5
        >>> removeDuplicates([])
        0
    """
    
    # Phase 1: Input Validation and Preprocessing
    # Check if nums is None (raise ValueError if None)
    if nums is None:
        raise ValueError("Input array cannot be None")
    
    # Handle empty array case (return 0 immediately)
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Verify array is non-strictly increasing by checking each element <= next element
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            raise ValueError("Input array must be non-strictly increasing")
    
    # Phase 2: Core Algorithm Implementation
    # Initialize slow pointer at index 1 (first element is always unique)
    slow = 1
    
    # Iterate through array with fast pointer starting from index 1
    for fast in range(1, len(nums)):
        # When nums[fast] != nums[fast-1], copy to slow pointer position
        if nums[fast] != nums[fast - 1]:
            nums[slow] = nums[fast]
            # Increment slow pointer when unique element found
            slow += 1
    
    # Phase 3: Result Processing and Formatting
    # Return slow pointer value as new length of unique elements
    return slow

    # Note: nums is already modified in-place up to the new length
    
    # Phase 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases
    # All edge cases are handled:
    # - Single-element array case (returns 1)
    # - All-elements-identical case (returns 1)
    # - Already-unique array case (returns len(nums))
    # - Bounds checking is inherent in the for loop structure
```

**Implementation Notes:**
1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks for None input and empty array cases before proceeding.
2. **Precondition Check**: Verifies the non-strictly increasing property as required.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Implements the core algorithm efficiently with O(n) time and O(1) space.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handles all specified edge cases naturally within the algorithm flow.
5. **In-Place Modification**: The original array is modified directly without using extra space.
6. **Type Safety**: Uses Python type hints for better code documentation.
7. **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.

**Testing Suggestions:**
```python
# Test cases
assert removeDuplicates([1,1,2]) == 2
assert removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]) == 5
assert removeDuplicates([]) == 0
assert removeDuplicates([1]) == 1
assert removeDuplicates([1,1,1,1]) == 1
assert removeDuplicates([1,2,3,4,5]) == 5

# Test for invalid inputs
try:
    removeDuplicates(None)
except ValueError as e:
    assert str(e) == "Input array cannot be None"

try:
    removeDuplicates([3,2,1])
except ValueError as e:
    assert str(e) == "Input array must be non-strictly increasing"
```

The implementation strictly follows the blueprint while maintaining all quality standards and requirements. The code is production-ready with proper error handling and documentation.
